<h3>Image Crawler Reactive Streams App With ParallelFlowable
(Assignment 4b)</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to continue to deepen your
experience using Java functional and reactive programming features and
their integration with the <A
HREF="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">RxJava</A> <A
HREF="http://reactivex.io/RxJava/3.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/rxjava3/parallel/ParallelFlowable.html">ParallelFlowable</A>
class to obtain, transform, and store images in parallel in a pool of
threads.</p>

<p> Like the earlier assignments, the code you'll write has a GUI and
runs as an Android app. Please use this GUI along with the unit tests
discussed below to help test and debug your solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul> <Li> A description of the RxJava <A
HREF="http://reactivex.io/RxJava/3.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/rxjava3/parallel/ParallelFlowable.html">ParallelFlowable</A>
class that compares and contrasts it with the RxJava flatMap()
concurrency idiom appears <A

</ul>

Naturally, we'll cover all this material in class, which will be
available in my YouTube CS253 playlist <A

<HR width=50% align=left> <h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p> Before you complete the initial submission of Assignment 4b you'll
need to do the following: </p>

<ul>

<li> Revise your implementation of <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment4a/">assignment
4a</a>, taking into account my review comments since it forms the
basis for the app in this assignment.  Please come to office hours or
make a post on Piazza if you have any questions about your assignment
4a solution. </li> <p>

<li> Integrate your solutions from previous assignments into this
assignment so that the auto-grader can check them all. Failure to
integrate your previous solutions will significantly lower your final
grade on this assignment. </li>

</ul>

<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using the latest
version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin and
Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 4b, however, you only need to be aware of the
following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/">image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as
described <A HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A>, which
contains a set of unit tests that exercise the features you're
implementing and are used to evaluate whether you've correctly
satisfied this assignment's requirements.  </LI>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 31, so you'll need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 31 (I recommend API 32). If you don't already have an Android
Emulator you can create one by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<A name="description">
<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO"
markers)!!!  In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the
following "TODO" tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/">imagecrawler</A>
folder:

<UL>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/RxFlowableCrawler.java">crawlers/RxFlowableCrawler.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to obtain,
transform, and store images.  This class uses <CODE>Flowable</CODE>
and <CODE>ParallelFlowable</CODE> operators in the RxJava framework to
perform an "image crawl" in parallel, starting from a root Uri.
Depending on the parameters used to run the app, images from HTML
pages reachable from the root Uri are either downloaded from a remote
web server or read from the local file system, transformed locally,
and the transformed results are then stored in the local file system
on the Android device. </p>

</LI> </p>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"><A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/common/Student.kt">common/Student.kt</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks to set the <CODE>type</CODE>
field to include just <CODE>Graduate</CODE> or
<CODE>Undergraduate</CODE>, depending on which version of the
assignment that you're implementing.</LI>

</UL>

<p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.  In
fact, a complete solution using Java 7 features is provided in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialLoopsCrawler.java">SequentialLoopsCrawler.java</A>
file.  You will therefore convert this Java 7-based class to the
<CODE>RxFlowableCrawler</CODE> class that uses RxJava. </p>

<p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or if/else statements
in this assignment and instead use RxJava operators and reactive
programming features.  Likewise, there should be only one call to
<code>blockingGet()</code>.  Your solution will be considered correct
if it passes all the unit tests, is commented thoroughly, and
addresses my review comments. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignments/assignment4b">here</a>
in my GitHub account.  Now that you've setup your <a
href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> The unit tests in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler">image-crawler/src/test</A>
folder are provided to increase our collective confidence that your
implementation is working as expected.  You'll need to use the Android
Studio GUI to run the unit test locally on your computer, as described
<A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>. </p>

<p> As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not
their absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect
problems in your code. However, make sure that your solution passes
the unit tests for this assignment and <em>all</em> previous
programming assignments since your final grade for assignment 4 will
be cumulative. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 4b replaces the RxJava flatMap() concurrency idiom in
Assignment 4a with the <code>ParallelFlowable</Code> class.  Please
start the assignment soon and ask questions in class, office hours,
and on the discussion forums.  As usual, the app, image crawler
skeletons, and unit tests are extensive, though you don't need to
understand them all to complete your solution successfully. </p>
