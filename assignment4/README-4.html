<h3>Image Crawler Reactive Streams Future App (Assignment 4)</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
Java functional programming features and their integration with Java
reactive streams.  In particular, in this assignment you'll develop an
app that uses the RxJava implementation of reactive streams to obtain,
transform, and store images.</p>

<p> Like the earlier assignments, the code you'll write here will have
GUI and will run as an Android app. Please use this GUI along with the
unit tests discussed below to help test and debug your solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li>A detailed overview of Java reactive streams (and a comparison
with Java streams) is available <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG2SEcl1aMM">here</A> and a
discussion of RxJava coding examples is available at <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUoFMCglRlY">here</a>.  </li>
<p>

<li>A tutorial overview of RxJava appear <A
HREF="https://www.baeldung.com/rxjava-tutorial">here</A>.  I recommend
you get the book <A
HREF="https://www.amazon.com/Reactive-Programming-RxJava-Asynchronous-Applications/dp/1491931655">Reactive
Programming with RxJava</A> to learn more about RxJava's support for
reactive streams. </li> </ul>

Naturally, we'll cover all this material in class, which will be
available in my YouTube CS253 playlist <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp6ca8KCAjj3HaworY-mqmCe">here</A>. <P>

<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using the latest
version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin and
Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 4, however, you only need to be aware of the
following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em">
<A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/">image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers</A>, which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as
described <A HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a set of unit tests
that exercise the features under test and can be used to evaluate
whether you've correctly satisfied this assignment's
requirements. </li>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests/assignment2aTests">app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests/assignment2aTests</A>,
which is an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically. </li>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The
application's minimum API is 29, so you will need to select an
emulator that uses an API >= 29. If you do not already have one
created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<p> In this part of the assignment you'll complete the implementation
of an image crawler class in the
<CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/RxObservableCrawler.java</CODE>
file that obtains, transforms, and stores images.  This class uses the
RxJava framework to perform an "image crawl" asynchronously, starting
from a root Uri.  Depending on the parameters used to run the tests,
images from HTML page reachable from the root Uri are either
downloaded from a remote web server or read from the local file system
and the results are stored in files. </p>

<p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.  In
fact, a complete solution using Java 7 features provided in the
<CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialLoopsCrawler.java</CODE>
file.  Your will therefore focus on converting this Java 7-based class
to the <CODE>RxObservableCrawler</CODE> class that uses the RxJava
framework. </p>

</ul>

<p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or (unnecessary)
conditional statements in this assignment and instead use RxJava's
classes and methods.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment4/">here</a>
in my GitHub account.  Now that you've setup your <a
href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> Unit tests in the
<code>image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler</code>
folder are provided to increase our confidence that your
implementation is working as expected.  You'll need to learn how to
use the Android Studio GUI to run the unit test locally on your
computer, as described <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems in
your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 4 is more complicated than the previous assignments.
In particular, the asynchronous nature of RxJava and reactive streams
may take some time to get accustomed to, so please start the
assignment soon and ask questions in class, office hours, and on the
discussion forums.  As usual, the app, image crawler skeletons, and
unit tests are extensive, though you don't need to understand them all
to complete your solution. </p>
