<h3>Image Crawler Parallel Stream Client App (Assignment 1b)</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
Java's functional programming features and their integration with
Java's parallel streams.  In particular, in this assignment you'll
develop an app that uses Java parallel streams to obtain, transform,
and store images.</p>

<p> Like the first part of this assignment, the code you'll write here
has a GUI, runs as an Android client app, and performs all image
processing locally on the client device.  Please use this GUI along
with the unit tests discussed below to help evaluate and debug your
solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li>Detailed overviews of the Java parallel streams framework are
available in <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp6ca8KCAjj3HaworY-mqmCe">this</A>
YouTube playlist.  Naturally, we'll cover this material in class,
which will be available in my YouTube CS253 playlist <A
HREF="://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4uV6IgyjGNH9U-Tx-9c4LN">here</A>.</li>
<p>

<li> The book <A
HREF="https://www.manning.com/books/modern-java-in-action">Modern Java
in Action</A> is a great resource to learn how to program Java
streams. </li> </ul>

<HR width=50% align=left> <h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p> Before you complete the initial submission of Assignment 1b you'll
need to do the following: </p>

<ul>

<li> Revise your implementation of <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment1a/">assignment
1a</a>, taking into account my review comments since it forms the
basis for the client app in this assignment.  Please come to office
hours or post questions on Piazza if you have any questions about your
assignment 1a solution. </li>

</ul>

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Assignment Structure and
Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using Android Studio.
This app is written in both Kotlin and Java and demonstrates
<EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the purposes of Assignment
1b, however, you only need to be aware of the following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/">imagecrawler/crawlers</A>,
which contains the skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A>, which is a
set of unit tests that exercise the features you're implementing and
are used to evaluate whether you've correctly satisfied this
assignment's requirements.  </LI>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="app/src/androidTest/">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is an
Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically. </li>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 31, so you'll need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 31 (I recommend API 32). If you don't already have an Android
Emulator you can create one by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <A name="description"></A> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" tags)!!!
In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the following "TODO"
tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/">imagecrawler/crawlers</A>
folder:

<UL>

<LI> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ParallelStreamsCrawler.java">imagecrawler/crawlers/ParallelStreamsCrawler.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to obtain,
transform, and store images.  This class uses Java parallel streams to
perform an "image crawl" starting from a root Uri.  It applies a
couple of minuscule tweaks to <A
HREF=image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialStreamsCrawler.java">SequentialStreamsCrawler.java</A>
class to use Java parallel streams. Depending on the parameters used
to run the tests, images from HTML pages reachable from the root Uri
are either downloaded from a remote web server or read from the local
file system and the results are stored in the local file system on the
Android device.  </LI> </p>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"><A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/Student.kt">Student.kt</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" to set the <CODE>type</CODE> field
to include just <CODE>Graduate</CODE> or <CODE>Undergraduate</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI>

</UL>

<p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or if/else statements
in this assignment and instead use Java parallel stream aggregate
operations and functional programming features. Your solution will be
considered correct if it passes all the unit and instrumentation
tests, is commented thoroughly, and addresses my review comments. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is
available <a href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment1b">here</a>
in my GitHub repository.  Now that you've setup
your <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can
pull this skeleton code into your repository, read it carefully, and
complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> The unit tests in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler">image-crawler/src/test</A>
folder are provided to increase our collective confidence that your
implementation is working as expected.  Please use the Android Studio
GUI to run the unit tests locally on your computer, as described <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems in
your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 1b is designed to deepen your experience developing
apps using Java functional programming features and Java parallel
streams without the need to create threads or program the Java
fork-join framework directly.  The skeletons and unit tests are
extensive, though you don't need to understand them all to complete
your solution.  Please start early and ask questions in class, office
hours, and on the Piazza discussion forum. </p>
