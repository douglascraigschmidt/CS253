<h3>Image Crawler Parallel Stream Client App (Assignment 3b)</h3>

<p>Part two of this assignment will deepen your experience using
Java's functional programming features and their integration with
Java's parallel streams by developing an app that uses Java parallel
streams to obtain, transform, and store images.  Like part one of this
assignment, the code you write has a GUI, runs as an Android client
app, and performs all image processing locally on the client device.
Please use this GUI along with the unit tests discussed below to help
evaluate and debug your solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li>Detailed overviews of the Java parallel streams framework are
available in <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp6ca8KCAjj3HaworY-mqmCe">this</A>
YouTube playlist.  
<p>

<li> The book <A
HREF="https://www.manning.com/books/modern-java-in-action">Modern Java
in Action</A> is a great resource to learn how to program Java
streams. </li> </ul>

<p>Naturally, we'll cover this material in class, which will be
available in my YouTube <A
HREF="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp5ZOxpx_RVkkktBMd0S5B6Q">
CS253 playlist</A>.  </p>

<HR width=50% align=left> <h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p> Before you complete the initial submission of Assignment 3b you'll
need to do the following: </p>

<ul>

<li> Revise your implementation of <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment3a/">assignment
3a</a>, taking into account my review comments since it forms the
basis for the client app in this assignment.  Please come to office
hours or post questions on Piazza if you have any concerns about your
assignment 3a solution and/or my comments on it. </li>

</ul>

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Assignment Structure and
Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using Android Studio.
This app is written in both Kotlin and Java and demonstrates
<EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the purposes of Assignment
3b, however, you only need to be aware of the following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/">imagecrawler/crawlers</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A>, which is a
set of unit tests that exercise the features you're implementing and
are used to evaluate whether you've correctly satisfied this
assignment's requirements.  </LI>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 31, so you'll need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 31 (I recommend API 34). You should already have Android
Emulator installed, but if not you can create one by clicking on the
"AVD Manager" button in the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <A name="description"></A> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java code
by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a working
solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just
fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" markers or your
code will not be reviewed)!!!  In particular, you need to finish
implementing the following "TODO" tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/">imagecrawler</A>
folder:

<UL>

<LI> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ParallelStreamsCrawler.java">crawlers/ParallelStreamsCrawler.java</A>.
You need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to obtain,
transform, and store images via Java parallel streams that perform an
"image crawl" starting from a root Uri. You should modify the <A
HREF=image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialStreamsCrawler.java">SequentialStreamsCrawler</A>
class to use Java parallel streams, e.g., by replacing
<code>flatMap()</code> (and in some places filter()) with the
<code>mapMulti()</CODE> idiom. Images from HTML pages reachable from
the root Uri are either downloaded from a remote web server or read
from the local file system and the results are stored in the Android
device's local file system.  </LI> </p>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"><A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/common/Student.kt">common/Student.kt</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" task to set the <CODE>type</CODE>
field to include just <CODE>Graduate</CODE> or
<CODE>Undergraduate</CODE>, depending on which version of the
assignment that you're implementing.</LI>

</UL>

<p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops and (only a handful of
if statements in the context of the <CODE>mapMulti()</CODE> idiom) in
this assignment and instead use Java parallel stream aggregate
operations and functional programming features. Your solution will be
considered correct if it passes all the unit tests, is commented
thoroughly, and addresses my review comments. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment3b">here</a>
in my GitHub repository.  Now that you've setup your <a
href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code into your repository, read it carefully, and complete
the "TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<P> Unit tests in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler">image-crawler/src/test</A>
folder are provided to increase our confidence that your
implementation is working as expected.  It's essential that you use
the Android Studio GUI to run these unit tests locally on your
computer, as described <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>
and shown later in this video. </P>

<P> As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not
their absence, so don't rely solely on the tests to detect problems in
your code. In particular, I will also provide videos that walk through
"frequently made mistakes" that you should address.  Please address
these issues prior to your submission(s) to streamline our <A
HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/cs253/assignments.html">programming
assignment review and assessment</A> process.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 3b is designed to deepen your experience developing
concurrent apps using Java functional programming features and Java
parallel streams without the need to create threads or program the
Java fork-join framework directly.  The skeletons and unit tests are
extensive, though you don't need to understand them all to complete
your solution.  Please start early and ask questions in class, office
hours, and on the Piazza discussion forum to ensure you complete this
assignment successfully! </p>
