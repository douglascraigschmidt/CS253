<h3>Image Crawler Parallel Streams Client App (Assignment 2)</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
Java's functional programming features and their integration with
Java's parallel streams and Spring WebMVC.  In particular, in this
assignment you'll develop a client/server app that uses Java parallel
streams to obtain, transform, and store images.</p>

<p> Like earlier assignments, the code you'll write here has a GUI and
runs as an Android client app that can either

<UL>

<LI> Perform all image processing locally on the client device running
Android or <P>

<LI> Perform all the image processing remotely using <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment2/server">microservices</a>
that can be deployed on one or more servers and implemented via Spring
WebMVC.

</uL>

Please use this GUI along with the unit tests discussed below to help
evaluate and debug your solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li>Detailed overviews of the Java parallel streams framework are
available in <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp6ca8KCAjj3HaworY-mqmCe">this</A>
YouTube playlist.  Naturally, we'll also cover this material in
class.</li> <p>

<li> The book <A
HREF="https://www.manning.com/books/modern-java-in-action">Modern Java
in Action</A> is a great resource to learn how to program Java
streams. </li> </ul>

<HR width=50% align=left> <h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p> Before you complete the initial submission of Assignment 2 you'll
need to do the following: </p>

<ul>

<li> Complete your implementation of <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment1b/">assignment
1b</a>, taking into account my review comments since they form the
basis for the client app in this assignment.  Please come to office
hours or post questions on Piazza if you have any remaining questions
about your assignment 1b solution. </li>

</ul>

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Assignment Structure and
Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using Android Studio.
This app is written in both Kotlin and Java and demonstrates
<EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the purposes of Assignment
2, however, you only need to be aware of the following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/">imagecrawler/crawlers</A>,
which contains the skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A>, which is a
set of unit tests that exercise the features you're implementing and
are used to evaluate whether you've correctly satisfied this
assignment's requirements.  </LI>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 31, so you'll need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 31 (I recommend API 32). If you don't already have an Android
Emulator you can create one by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <A name="description"></A> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" tags)!!!
In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the following "TODO"
tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/">imagecrawler/crawlers</A>
folder:

<UL>

<LI> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ParallelStreamsCrawler.java">imagecrawler/crawlers/ParallelStreamsCrawler.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to obtain,
transform, and store images both locally and remotely.  This class
uses Java parallel streams to perform an "image crawl" starting from a
root Uri. <P>

<p>Depending on the parameters used to run the app, images from HTML
pages reachable from the root Uri are either downloaded from a remote
web server or read from the local file system, transformed locally,
and the transformed results are then stored in the local file system
on the Android device.  Likewise, these parameters also determine
whether all image processing is either performed locally on the client
device or remotely using microservices deployed on one or more
servers. </p>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"><A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/Student.kt">Student.kt</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" to set the <CODE>type</CODE> field
to include just <CODE>Graduate</CODE> or <CODE>Undergraduate</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI>

</UL>

<p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or if/else statements
in this assignment and instead use Java parallel stream aggregate
operations and functional programming features. Your solution will be
considered correct if it passes all the unit tests, is commented
thoroughly, and addresses my review comments. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment2">here</a>
in my GitHub repository in the <CODE>client</CODE> folder.  Now that
you've setup your <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>
account you can pull this skeleton code in your repository, read it
carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> The unit tests in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler">image-crawler/src/test</A>
folder are provided to increase our collective confidence that your
implementation is working as expected.  Please use the Android Studio
GUI to run the unit tests locally on your computer, as described <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems in
your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 2 is designed to deepen your experience developing apps
using Java functional programming features and Java parallel streams
in conjunction with Spring WebMVC.  The skeletons and unit tests are
extensive, though you don't need to understand them all to complete
your solution.  Please start early and ask questions in class, office
hours, and on the Piazza discussion forum. </p>
