    The FAB thickness calculation isn't quite right, it's always
    smaller than the value set here. This is because the progress
    bar does not draw it's ring at the outside of its layout area,
    but instead, draws it with approximately a 10dp inset. So the
    best way to position a ProgressFab and set its ring thickness
    is to just play with these 2 settings until it looks right.
