<hr> <h3>Microservices Image Processing Server App (Assignment 2)</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
Java functional programming features and their integration with Java
parallel streams and Spring microservices.  In particular, for this
assignment you'll develop a server app that uses Spring WebMVC to
create microservices that receive images from an <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment2/client/">Android
client app</a> and return updated images after applying the requested
transforms.</p>

<p> Unlike the earlier assignments, the code you'll write here will
not have its own GUI.  Instead, it will be accessed via an Android
client app that can either perform all image processing locally on the
client device or remotely using microservices deployed on one or more
servers. Please use the Android client app portion of assignment
2--along with the unit tests discussed below--to help evaluate and
debug your solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li>A tutorial overview of Spring WebMVC and its support for
microservices appears <A
HREF="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/spring_web_mvc_framework.htm">here</A>.
</li> </ul>

Naturally, we'll cover all this material in class. <P>

<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The microservices image processing server app is packaged as a
project using the latest version of <A
HREF="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download"">IntelliJ</A>.  This
app is written in Java and demonstrates many Spring WebMVC
capabilities.  For the purposes of this assignment, however, you only
need to be aware of the following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="src/main/java/server/">src/main/java/server</A>, whose <A
HREF="src/main/java/server/main/">main</A> and <A
HREF="src/main/java/server/microservices/common">microservices/common</A>
folders contain the skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="src/test/java">src/test/java</A>, which is a set of unit tests
that exercise key features in the server and can be used to evaluate
whether you've correctly satisfied this assignment's
requirements. </li>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided IntelliJ project.
You can start all the microservices that are part of this project by
clicking the green "Run 'Microservices'" button or by starting each
microservice independently via the IntelliJ IDE .</P>

<hr width=50% align=left>
<A name="description">
<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" tags)!!!
In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the following "TODO"
tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="src/main/java/server/">src/main/java/server</A> folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <A
HREF="src/main/java/server/MainController">MainController.java</A> and
<A
HREF="src/main/java/server/MainService">MainService.java</A>. You'll
need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods that implement an
app gateway entry point for remote clients that want an image to be
processed by a set of image transforms via Java parallel streams.
</P>

<LI> <A
HREF="src/main/java/server/microservices/common/TransformController">TransformController.java</A>
and <A
HREF="src/main/java/server/microservices/common/TransformService">TransformService.java</A>. You'll
need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods that implement a
microservice entry point that transforms the image by applying a
transform operation thereby producing a new modified image that is
then returned to the client.  </P>

</UL>

<p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or (unnecessary)
conditional statements in this assignment and instead use Java
parallel streams operations. Your solution will be considered correct
if it passes all the unit tests and communicates properly with the
Android client app. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment2">here</a>
in the <CODE>server</CODE> folder of my GitHub repository.  You can
pull this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> Unit tests in the <A HREF="src/test/java">src/test/java</A> folder
are provided to increase our/your confidence that your implementation
is working as expected.  As usual, testing only demonstrates the
presence of bugs, not their absence, so don't rely solely on the unit
tests to detect problems in your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> This client/server assignment is more complicated than the
previous assignments since it requires deeper knowledge of Spring
WebMVC's annotation-based approach to remote communication.
Therefore, please start the assignment soon and ask questions in
class, office hours, and on the discussion forums.  As usual, the
microservices image processing server app skeletons and unit tests are
extensive, though you don't need to understand them all to complete
your solution. </p>
