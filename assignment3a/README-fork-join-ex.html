<h3>Image Crawler Streams-based Fork-Join Pool App (Assignment 2)</h3>

<p>This assignment deepens your experience combining Java sequential
streams and the Java fork-join framework (which the Java parallel
streams and completable futures frameworks use as their default
parallel computing engine, as shown in future assignments).  Here
you'll use the Java fork-join framework and Java sequential streams to
obtain, transform, and store images in parallel.  </p>

<p> Like the first assignment, the code you'll write here will have
GUI and will run as an Android app. Please use this GUI along with the
unit tests discussed below to help debug and evaluate your
solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

videos 20 thru 24 this <a

<hr width=50% align=left> <H4>Assignment Structure and
Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using the latest
version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin and
Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 2, however, you only need to be aware of the
following folders:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/">imagecrawler/crawlers</A>,
which contain the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A>, which is a
set of unit tests that exercise the features you're implementing and
are used to evaluate whether you've correctly satisfied this
assignment's requirements.  </LI>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 31, so you'll need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 31 (I recommend API 33). If you don't already have an Android
Emulator you can create one by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <A name="description"></A> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" markers
or your code will not be reviewed)!!!  In particular, you'll need to
finish implementing the following "TODO" tasks for this assignment in
the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/">imagecrawler</A>
folder:

<UL>

<LI> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ForkJoinExCrawler.java">crawlers/ForkJoinExCrawler.java</A>. You'll
complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to obtain, transform, and
store images.  This class uses the Java fork-join and sequential
streams frameworks to perform an "image crawl" starting from a root
Uri.  Depending on the parameters used to run the tests, images from
an HTML page reachable from the root Uri are either downloaded from a
remote web server or read from the local file system and the results
are stored in locally in files on the Android computing device. </p>

<P>All students must use Java lambda expressions, method references, and
sequential streams for their <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ForkJoinExCrawler.java">ForkJoinExCrawler.java</A>
implementation. </P>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"><A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/common/Student.kt">common/Student.kt</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" marker to set the <CODE>type</CODE>
field to be either <CODE>Graduate</CODE> or
<CODE>Undergraduate</CODE>, depending on how you are enrolled in this
course.</LI>

</UL>

<p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.  In
fact, a complete solution using Java 7 features is provided in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialLoopsCrawler.java">SequentialLoopsCrawler.java</A>
file.  You will therefore convert this Java 7-based class to the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ForkJoinExCrawler.java">ForkJoinExCrawler</A>
class that uses the Java fork-join and sequential streams
frameworks. </p>

<p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or if/else statements
in this assignment and instead use Java sequential stream aggregate
operations, fork-join pool methods, and functional programming
features. Your solution will be considered correct if it passes all
the unit tests, is commented thoroughly, and addresses my review
comments. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available at <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment2/">this
link</a> in my GitHub account.  Now that you've setup your <a
href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code into your repository, read it carefully, and complete
the "TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<P> Unit tests in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler">image-crawler/src/test</A>
folder are provided to increase our confidence that your
implementation is working as expected.  It's essential that you use
the Android Studio GUI to run these unit tests locally on your
computer, as described <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>
and shown later in this video. </P>

<P>As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
absence, so don't rely solely on the tests to detect problems in your
code. In particular, I will also provide videos that walk through
"frequently made mistakes" that you should address.  Please address
these issues prior to your submission(s) to streamline our <A
HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/cs253/assignments.html">programming
assignment review and assessment</A> process.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 2 is designed to give you experience using Java
sequential streams to structure the control flow of the Java fork-join
framework APIs.  There are more "moving parts" in this assignment
compared with later assignments that focus on Java parallel streams,
which hides these fork-join details from app developers.  Therefore,
please start the assignment soon and ask questions in class, office
hours, and on the discussion forums.  The app, image crawler
skeletons, and unit tests are extensive, though you don't need to
understand them all to complete your solution successfully. </p>
