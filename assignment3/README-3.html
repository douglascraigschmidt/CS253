<h3>Image Crawler Completable Futures App (Assignment 3)</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
Java's functional programming features and their integration with
Java's completable futures framework.  In particular, in this
assignment you'll develop an app that uses Java's completable futures
framework in conjunction with Java's sequential streams framework to
obtain, transform, and store images asynchronously in a pool of
threads.</p>

<p> Like the earlier assignments, the code you'll write here will have
a GUI and will run as an Android app. Please use this GUI along with
the unit tests outlined below to help debug and evaluate your
solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li>Detailed overviews of Java's completable futures framework are
available in videos from one of my <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4uV6IgyjGNH9U-Tx-9c4LN">YouTube
playlists</a>. Naturally, we'll cover this material in class, which
will be available in my YouTube CS253 playlist <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4sVQVC39gwaXByHiV08Zb3">here</A>.</li>
<p>

<li>Good overviews of Java's completable futures framework appear <A

HREF="http://www.nurkiewicz.com/2013/05/java-8-definitive-guide-to.html">here</A>.
I highly recommend you get the book <A

in Action</A> to learn more about Java's completable futures
framework. </li> </ul>

<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using the latest
version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin and
Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 3, however, you only need to be aware of the
following folders:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/">imagecrawler/crawlers</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A>, which
contains a set of unit tests that exercise the features you're
implementing and are used to evaluate whether you've correctly
satisfied this assignment's requirements.  </LI>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 31, so you'll need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 31 (I recommend API 32). If you don't already have an Android
Emulator you can create one by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<A name="description">
<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" tags)!!!
In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the following "TODO"
tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/">imagecrawler/crawlers</A>
folder:

<UL>

<LI> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/CompletableFutureCrawler.java">imagecrawler/crawlers/CompletableFutureCrawler.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to obtain,
transform, and store images asynchronously.  This class uses the Java
completable futures framework to perform an "image crawl"
asynchronously, starting from a root Uri.  Depending on the parameters
used to run the app, images from HTML pages reachable from the root
Uri are either downloaded from a remote web server or read from the
local file system, transformed locally, and the transformed results
are then stored in the local file system on the Android device.

</LI> </p>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"><A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/Student.kt">Student.kt</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" to set the <CODE>type</CODE> field
to include just <CODE>Graduate</CODE> or <CODE>Undergraduate</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI>

</UL>

<p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.  In
fact, a complete solution using Java 7 features is provided in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialLoopsCrawler.java">SequentialLoopsCrawler.java</A>
file.  Your will therefore convert this Java 7-based class to the
<CODE>CompletableFutureCrawler</CODE> class that uses Java completable
futures. </p>

<p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or if/else statements
in this assignment and instead use Java completable futures methods
and functional programming features.  Likewise, there should be only
one call to <code>join()</code> and no calls to <code>get()</code>.
Your solution will be considered correct if it passes all the unit
tests, is commented thoroughly, and addresses my review comments. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment3/">here</a>
in my GitHub repository.  Now that you've setup your <a
href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> The unit tests in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler">image-crawler/src/test</A>
folder are provided to increase our collective confidence that your
implementation is working as expected.  Please use the Android Studio
GUI to run the unit tests locally on your computer, as described <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems in
your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 3 is more complicated than the previous assignments.
In particular, the asynchronous nature of Java's completable futures
framework may take some time to get accustomed to, so please start the
assignment soon and ask questions in class, office hours, and on the
Piazza discussion forum.  As usual, the app, image crawler skeletons,
and unit tests are extensive, though you don't need to understand them
all to complete your solution. </p>
