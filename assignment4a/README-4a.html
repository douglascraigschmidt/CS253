<h3>Image Crawler Reactive Streams App With Local Transforms
(Assignment 4a)</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
Java's functional programming features and Java's reactive streams.
In particular, in this assignment you'll develop an app that uses the
<A HREF="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">RxJava</A>
implementation of the <A
HREF="https://www.reactive-streams.org/">reactive streams</a>
specification to obtain, transform, and store images asynchronously in
a pool of threads.</p>

<p> Like the earlier assignments, the code you'll write has a GUI and
runs as an Android app. Please use this GUI along with the unit tests
discussed below to help test and debug your solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li> Videos on Java reactive streams and RxJava appear in my YouTube
playlist <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp6WomQBCUPnDML29LDjYNCj">here</a>. </li> <P>

<li>Tutorials on RxJava appear <A

Naturally, we'll cover all this material in class, which will be
available in my YouTube CS253 playlist <A

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Assignment Structure and
Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using the latest
version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin and
Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 4a, however, you only need to be aware of the
following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/">image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A>, which
contains a set of unit tests that exercise the features you're
implementing and are used to evaluate whether you've correctly
satisfied this assignment's requirements.  </LI>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 31, so you'll need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 31 (I recommend API 32). If you don't already have an Android
Emulator you can create one by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <A name="description"> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO"
markers)!!!  In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the
following "TODO" tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/">imagecrawler</A>
folder:

<UL>

<LI> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/RxObservableCrawler.java">crawlers/RxObservableCrawler.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to obtain,
transform, and store images.  This class uses <CODE>Observable</CODE>
operators in RxJava to perform an "image crawl" asynchronously,
starting from a root Uri.  Depending on the parameters used to run the
app, images from HTML pages reachable from the root Uri are either
downloaded from a remote web server or read from the local file
system, transformed locally, and the transformed results are then
stored in the local file system on the Android device.

</LI> </p>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"><A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/common/Student.kt">common/Student.kt</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" to set the <CODE>type</CODE> field
to include just <CODE>Graduate</CODE> or <CODE>Undergraduate</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI>

</UL>

<p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.  In
fact, a complete solution using Java 7 features is provided in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialLoopsCrawler.java">SequentialLoopsCrawler.java</A>
file.  You will therefore convert this Java 7-based class to the
<CODE>RxObservableCrawler</CODE> class that uses RxJava. </p>

<p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or if/else statements
in this assignment and instead use RxJava operators and functional
programming features.  Likewise, there should be only one call to
<code>blockingGet()</code>.  Your solution will be considered correct
if it passes all the unit tests, is commented thoroughly, and
addresses my review comments. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignments/assignment4a/">here</a>
in my GitHub account.  Now that you've setup your <a
href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> The unit tests in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler">image-crawler/src/test</A>
folder are provided to increase our collective confidence that your
implementation is working as expected.  You'll need to use the Android
Studio GUI to run the unit tests locally on your computer, as
described <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems in
your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 4a is more complicated than the previous assignments.
In particular, the asynchronous nature of RxJava and reactive streams
may take some time to get accustomed to, so please start the
assignment soon and ask questions in class, office hours, and on the
discussion forums.  As usual, the app, image crawler skeletons, and
unit tests are extensive, though you don't need to understand them all
to complete your solution successfully. </p>
